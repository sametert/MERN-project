# Ankara Medipol University Student Panel (MERN Stack)

This project is a full-stack application developed as part of my graduation project at Ankara Medipol University. The aim was to build a comprehensive student panel system using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This panel enables students to manage their academic information seamlessly.


## Features

- 	Frontend: Developed using React with TypeScript and CSS for a modular and maintainable UI.

	Created 30+ reusable components to ensure a consistent user interface across the platform.
- 	Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and manage data efficiently.
	
    Implemented 24 API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.
	
    MongoDB was used as the database to handle large datasets, with an optimized data read/write time of under 100ms.

  
## Technologies Used

**Frontend:** React.js (with TypeScript) , CSS

**Backend:** Node.js ,
Express.js , MongoDB

  
## Key Achievements

	•	Developed a scalable and reusable component architecture using React and TypeScript.
	•	Managed large datasets and optimized backend performance to keep response times under 100ms.
	•	Integrated MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring fast load times even with large data volumes.
